Process Event Log Analysis (Python)

Analyzed structured process event logs to evaluate workflow efficiency, case progression, and operational bottlenecks. The project focused on identifying activity patterns, calculating case cycle times, and detecting rework or inefficiencies within business processes.

🔹 Key Contributions:

Cleaned and transformed timestamp-based event log data using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

Calculated case duration, activity frequency, and transition sequences to understand process flow.

Built activity transition matrices to identify the most frequent process paths.

Detected bottlenecks and repeated activities (rework analysis) to highlight inefficiencies.

Visualized process metrics using Matplotlib to support data-driven decision-making.

🔹 Business Impact:

Improved visibility into workflow performance.

Enabled identification of delay points and resource-heavy activities.

Supported process optimization and operational efficiency analysis.

🔹 Tools & Skills Used:

Python | Pandas | NumPy | Data Cleaning | EDA | Process Mining Concepts | Data Visualization
